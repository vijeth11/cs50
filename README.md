# Project 2

Created a chat app called sharedilse where people can text each other and share files,images etc. they can create their own group and text each other.

### To run in local system:
    1. clone the repository
    2. point the path to server folder in command promt and run flask run --reload for development or flask run for prod or python app.py        --relodad
## Deploy in Heroku
Link this branch in the heroku github link and Procfile will handle the deployment

### Some fixes needs to be done and requirement file needs to be updated
Socket.io is not working properly so deployment is not successfull
