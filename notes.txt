to create an admin python manage.py createsuperuser
enter password and name use it to login as admin adding /admin/ in url
to get id define the id in the path in url like path("<int:flightid>",views.flight) and use the same id name as argument in the function like flight(request,flightid)
the name attribute in the path is used for routing within the html like <a href="{% url 'flight' flight.id%}">{{flight}}</a> in this example we are writing flight.id because we need pass an id to that url
